# @stdext/database/sql

The SQL package contains a standard interface for SQL based databases.

Inspired by [rust sqlx](https://docs.rs/sqlx/latest/sqlx/index.html) and
[go sql](https://pkg.go.dev/database/sql). The full specification is available
in [RFC_SQL.md](../RFC_SQL.md).

The goal for this package is to have a standard interface for SQL-like database
clients that can be used in Deno, Node and other JS runtimes. Applications use a
driver with its preconfigured client, such as
[`@stdext/database/drivers/sqlite`](../README.md); this entrypoint is meant for
driver authors and for applications that wire up a driver with the standard
client themselves.

## Design

The specification has two levels, as in Go's `database/sql/driver` and
`database/sql`; see [the specification](../RFC_SQL.md#specification) for the
details:

- **Driver level**: the minimal interface a database driver implements:
  connecting, and executing, querying, preparing and transactions on a single
  connection. Its types are `Driver` and `DriverConnection`, with their
  `DriverRows`, `DriverStatement` and `DriverTransaction`, and the `Dialect`
  (see [core.ts](./core.ts))
- **Client level**: the user facing interface: pooling, nested transactions, SQL
  templates, lazy results, prepared statement caching, events and options. It is
  implemented once, generically on top of any driver, by the standard
  `SqlClient` ([client.ts](./client.ts)), so that its behavior is the same for
  every database. Drivers do not implement it, but export a preconfigured client
  bound to their driver, such as `SqliteClient`

The client level is composed of small capability interfaces, such as
`Connectable`, `Queryable`, `Preparable`, `Transactionable`, `Poolable`,
`Eventable` and `Dialectable`, so that tools can depend only on the capabilities
they need (see [core.ts](./core.ts)).

Key properties of the design:

- All methods are async, except the client level `query`, which returns a lazy
  result whose consuming methods resolve to promises
- Pooling is implicit: a `Client` always manages a connection pool, tuned with
  the `poolOptions` in its constructor options. It defaults to a single
  connection (`maxSize` of `1`) and becomes a connection pool when `maxSize` is
  raised
- The query surface is minimal: `execute` for statements and `query` for queries
  returning a lazy `ResultIterableContext`
- Everything holding a resource (the `Client`, a `Connection` acquired from the
  pool, a `Transaction`, a `PreparedStatement`, and the query result context) is
  `AsyncDisposable` and works with `await using`

## Usage

The examples use the SQLite driver, but every driver implementing the interfaces
is used the same way:

```ts
import { SqliteClient } from "@stdext/database/drivers/sqlite";

await using client = new SqliteClient(":memory:");
await client.execute("CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER, name TEXT)");
await client.execute("INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'Alice')");

console.log(await client.query("SELECT * FROM users").toRecords());
// [{ id: 1, name: "Alice" }]
```

The connection is opened by the first operation; calling `connect()` connects
eagerly, for example to report connection errors early. The connection is closed
by calling `close()`, or automatically at the end of the scope when using
[AsyncDispose](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-explicit-resource-management).

### Queries

The query methods are defined in [core.ts](./core.ts) (`Queryable`):

- `execute(sql, params?, options?)`: Executes a single SQL statement, and
  resolves to the `affectedRows` (rows inserted, updated or deleted, `0` for
  other statements) and the `lastInsertId`, if the database reports it
- `query(sql, params?, options?)`: Returns a lazy `ResultIterableContext` for a
  single SQL statement, which is both an async iterable of rows and provides
  `columns()`, `toValues()` and `toRecords()`. The query runs when the result is
  consumed, and holds its connection until it is fully read or disposed
- `executeScript(sql, options?)`: Executes a script of one or more statements
  without parameters, such as a migration

The placeholder style of the parameters (`?`, `$1`, `:name`, ...) and the
mapping of values depend on the driver.

```ts
import { sql } from "@stdext/database/sql";
import { SqliteClient } from "@stdext/database/drivers/sqlite";

await using client = new SqliteClient(":memory:");
await client.execute("CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER, name TEXT)");

// Iterate lazily
for await (const row of client.query("SELECT * FROM users")) {
  console.log(row.toRecord());
}

// Or collect
console.log(await client.query("SELECT * FROM users").toRecords());

// SQL templates render the placeholders of the database
const name = "Alice";
await client.execute(sql`INSERT INTO users VALUES (${1}, ${name})`);
```

The rows are streamed and not kept in memory, so a result can be consumed once:
iterated or collected. The result is `AsyncDisposable`: disposing stops fetching
and releases the underlying connection.

### Prepared statements

Prepared statements are created with `prepare` (`Preparable`):

```ts
import { SqliteClient } from "@stdext/database/drivers/sqlite";

await using client = new SqliteClient(":memory:");
await client.execute("CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER, name TEXT)");
await using stmt = await client.prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?");
console.log(await stmt.query([1]).toRecords());
// disposed (deallocated) at the end of the scope
```

### Transactions

Transactions are created with `beginTransaction` or the `transaction` wrapper
(`Transactionable`):

```ts
import { SqliteClient } from "@stdext/database/drivers/sqlite";

await using client = new SqliteClient(":memory:");
await client.execute("CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER, name TEXT)");
await using tx = await client.beginTransaction();
await tx.execute("INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'Alice')");
await tx.commit();
// if the scope ends without a commit, the transaction is rolled back
```

```ts
import { SqliteClient } from "@stdext/database/drivers/sqlite";

await using client = new SqliteClient(":memory:");
await client.execute("CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER, name TEXT)");
const result = await client.transaction(async (tx) => {
  await tx.execute("INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'Alice')");
  return await tx.query("SELECT * FROM users").toRecords();
});
```

Transactions can be nested: calling `beginTransaction` or `transaction` on an
active transaction creates a savepoint. Committing a nested transaction releases
the savepoint, and rolling it back rolls back to the savepoint, leaving the
enclosing transaction active. Nesting only applies on the same connection —
`client.transaction()` inside a transaction acquires a separate connection and
starts an independent transaction.

### Pooling

A `Client` always manages a pool of connections, tuned with `poolOptions`:

- `lazyInitialization` (default `false`): connections are only created when
  acquired and no idle connection is available
- `maxSize` (default `1`): the maximum amount of connections. With the default,
  the client behaves like a single connection; it becomes a connection pool when
  raised
- `acquireTimeout`: how long `acquire` waits for a connection, in milliseconds
- `idleTimeout`: how long a connection may be idle before it is closed, in
  milliseconds
- `maxLifetime`: the maximum age of a connection, in milliseconds

Query methods automatically acquire a connection and release it when the
operation completes. A `query` result acquires its connection when the query
runs, and holds it until the result is fully read or disposed.
`beginTransaction` and `prepare` hold a pooled connection until the transaction
is finished or the prepared statement is deallocated. A connection can also be
held manually:

```ts
import { SqliteClient } from "@stdext/database/drivers/sqlite";

await using client = new SqliteClient(":memory:");
await client.execute("CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER, name TEXT)");
await using connection = await client.acquire();
await connection.execute("INSERT INTO users VALUES (2, 'Bob')");
// released back to the pool at the end of the scope
```

### Events

The following events can be subscribed to (see [events.ts](./events.ts)):

- `connect`: dispatched when a connection is established
- `close`: dispatched when a connection is about to be closed
- `error`: dispatched when an error is triggered
- `acquire` / `release` (client only): dispatched when a connection is acquired
  from or released back to the pool

All events carry a `client` detail with the object that dispatched the event;
`error` events additionally carry the `error`.

## Implementation

> This section is for implementing the driver level for a database.

A driver implements the [driver level](../RFC_SQL.md#driver-level): a `Driver`
with a `Dialect`, and its `DriverConnection`, `DriverRows`, `DriverStatement`
and `DriverTransaction` (see [core.ts](./core.ts)). The client level does not
need to be implemented: the standard `SqlClient` works on top of any driver, and
a driver usually exports a preconfigured client bound to it:

```ts ignore
import type { ClientOptions } from "@stdext/database/sql";
import { SqlClient } from "@stdext/database/sql";

export class MyDriver implements Driver {
  /* connect, and run statements on a single connection */
}

export class MyClient extends SqlClient<MyDriver> {
  constructor(url: string | URL, options?: ClientOptions) {
    super(new MyDriver(), url, options);
  }
}
```

Helper utilities for driver authors are available in [utils.ts](./utils.ts) and
[template.ts](./template.ts):

- `createResultIterableContext(source)`: builds a lazy, single-pass
  `ResultIterableContext` from the columns and rows of a started query
- `renderStatement(statement, params, placeholder)`: renders SQL text or a
  `SqlTemplate` with the placeholders of the database
- `getObjectFromRow(row)`: maps a row to a record

### Testing

The `@stdext/database/sql/testing` entrypoint contains two conformance suites. A
driver that passes the driver suite, and whose client passes the client suite,
is compliant with the specification:

```ts ignore
import { testClient, testDriver } from "@stdext/database/sql/testing";

Deno.test("MyDriver conformance", async (t) => {
  await testDriver(t, new MyDriver(), url, sql);
});

Deno.test("MyClient conformance", async (t) => {
  await testClient(t, (options) => new MyClient(url, options), sql);
});
```

Both suites take the `TestSql` statements of the database dialect, such as a
query selecting a string parameter. `testDriver` tests the driver level against
a URL, so that a library that only implements a driver can verify it;
`testClient` tests the client level with a factory creating a client, so that
the standard implementation over a driver, and alternative implementations, can
be verified.

The suites also check parameter binding, SQL templates, value transforms,
aborting with an `AbortSignal`, error types, nested transactions, events and the
pooling behavior.
