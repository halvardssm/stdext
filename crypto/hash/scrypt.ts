/**
 * Scrypt password hashing, backed by WebAssembly.
 *
 * The hashes are PHC strings (`$scrypt$ln=17,r=8,p=1$...`) that embed the options and salt, so
 * {@linkcode verify} reads them from the hash. Prefer the
 * algorithm-agnostic versions in `@stdext/crypto/hash` unless you need
 * scrypt-specific options.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { hash, verify } from "@stdext/crypto/hash/scrypt";
 * import { assert } from "@std/assert";
 *
 * const h = hash("password", { logN: 10 });
 * assert(verify("password", h));
 * ```
